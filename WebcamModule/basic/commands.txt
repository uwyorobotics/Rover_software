check camera exists:  ls /dev/ | grep video
check USB_cam downloaded : ls /dev/ | grep video
check openCV downloaded: sudo apt install ros-noetic-perception
check ros environment properly sourced: terminal:gedit ~/.bashrc
	make sure the line "source /opt/ros/noetic/seup.bash is in the file

create the workspace
in the working filder you want to be working in, make a directory called src (source)
run a catkin make on the workspace
Make sure the package is sourced right by using: source ~/<working directory name>/devel/setup.bash
check the soucring by typing echo $ROS_PAcKAGe_PATH
in the source folder:
catkin_create_pkg ros_open_cv image_transport cv_bridge sensor_msgs rospy rosccp std_msgs
this copies in the source code we need to run open cv. it also creates the subfolder ros_open_cv

in that subfolder ros_open_cv...
	make a directory to hold the python scripts we will write
	mkdir Scripts
go into the scripts folder

this is wehre the fun begins:
write the publisher program!
:gedit cam_pub.py
write the code to capture the images and publish them to a topic

make the file into an excecuteable
:chmod +x cam_pub.py

create the subscriber node
gedit cam_ub.py
#i fucked up and clled it cam_sub.py instead of cam_sub.py (should really be cam_soda.py)

drop back down a folder
cd ..
gedit CMakeLists.txt

Change this:
catkin_install_python(PROGRAMS
	scripts/cam_pub.py#make this name to be script 1
	scripts/cam_ub.py#majke this name to be script 2
	DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}
)

go to the workspace folder and run a catkin make
catkin_make

in three new terminals, run the following 
TERMINAL 1
:roscore

TERMINAL 2
source ~/Desktop/ROSCam_OPencv/devel/setup.bash
rosrun ROSCAm_OPencv cam_pub.py

TERMINAL 3 
source ~/Desktop/ROSCam_OPencv/devel/setup.bash
rosrun  ROSCAm_OPencv cam_ub.py


working terminal = ROSCam_OPencv
